# Car Performance Dashboard

## Project Overview

The Car Performance Dashboard is an interactive web application that visualizes various performance metrics collected from a vehicle's On-Board Diagnostics (OBD-II) system. Users can monitor real-time and historical data related to their vehicle's speed, fuel consumption, and engine health, providing valuable insights into performance and maintenance needs.

## Key Features

1. **Real-Time Data Visualization**: Display live metrics such as speed, RPM, and fuel level using dynamic graphs.
2. **Historical Data Analysis**: Allow users to view historical performance data over different time frames (daily, weekly, monthly).
3. **Interactive Graphs**: Users can hover over graphs to see detailed data points and trends, enhancing the user experience.
4. **Alerts and Notifications**: Include thresholds for performance metrics that trigger alerts (e.g., high fuel consumption).
5. **User-Friendly Interface**: An intuitive layout with clearly labeled sections for each performance metric.
6. **3D Car Model**: Interactive 3D model of a car that rotates, providing a visually appealing centerpiece to the dashboard.
